## How to run locally

Running this project is easy, the first thing that you need to actually do before running it is to create a `.env` file in the root directory and put your **OpenWeather** API key there.

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_OPEN_WEATHER_API_KEY=<YOUR-TOKEN>
```

Then, all that is left is to install the dependencies that the project uses.

```
yarn install
```

And thatâ€™s it, you now can run the project with

```
yarn dev
```
